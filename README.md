## SWI Web Panel for Xtheme IRC Services (and Atheme & Atheme forks)

SWI is a simple web panel for Xtheme IRC services. It aims to be clean, sleek and fast. With minimul installation and configuration required.
SWI is a fork of EGs (https://bitbucket.org/jnewing/egs) with some bug fixes, cosmetic improvements and additional features and consoles in
an effort to give users of networks running Atheme Services the ultimate control over their IRC accounts, nicknames, channels, memos, vhosts
and BotServ use via the World Wide Web.

## Notable New Features:

    1) NickServ Settings page
	2) ChanServ Settings page
	3) ChanServ WAITING list added to OperServ dashboard for networks running chanserv/moderate with Atheme (optional)
	4) HostServ WAITING list added to OperServ dashboard (optional)
	5) BotServ consoles added: BOTLIST, ASSIGN, UNASSIGN and BOT MANAGEMENT (add/change/delete) for Services Operators
    6) Current Sessions page added to main dashboard
	7) Facebook & Twitter links for networks (optional)
	8) GroupServ console & functionality added (optional)
	9) ReCaptcha v2
	10) Configure whether to show +qah in flags assistance to users based on how the network is configured.
	11) Update to core framework for newer versions of PHP to get rid of warnings and notices.
	12) Update config.php to config.example.php so that existing configs are not overwritten by updates.

## Installation

During this installation I'm going to assume a few things.

    1) that you know your way around a shell
    2) that you have some understanding of the mysql cli client tool
    3) That you have Xtheme IRC Services (or an Atheme fork) experience running with both the httpd and xmlrpc modules running.


First your going to need to obtain a copy of SWI one can be found here

	https://github.com/XthemeOrg/SWI/

Next up you're going to have to edit the swi/config/config.example.php file to reflect the settings of your web server and Xtheme installation.

Cleaner URI's (**Optional**)

You may want to remove the index.php in the URI.

	http://www.yournetwork.net/swi/index.php/more/stuffhere

to something like

	http://www.yournetwork.net/swi/more/stuffhere

This is current supported on Apache, Lighttpd, Nginx and any other web server that supports some form of URI re-writing. Below I've included a few example of re-writes.

**Apache**

	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
		RewriteEngine On
		
		# You need to change the path to match that of your installation.
		# For example if you installed the SWI system to http://www.yournetwork.net/swi/ you would 
		# change that line to read:
    	# RewriteBase /swi/
		#     
		# Alternately if your install was located on a subdomain example: http://services.yournetwork.net 
		# we would change the RewriteBase line to read:
		# RewriteBase /
		
		RewriteBase /swi/
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.*
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^application.*
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
	</IfModule>
	
	<IfModule !mod_rewrite.c>
		ErrorDocument 404 /index.php
	</IfModule>


**Lighthttpd**

	url.rewrite-once = (
 		"/(.*)\.(.*)" => "$0",
 		"/(css|files|img|js|stats)/" => "$0",
 		"^/([^.]+)$" => "/index.php/$1"
	)

**Nginx**

 	server {
    
    	listen   80;
    	
    	root /var/www/nginx-default/;
    	access_log  /var/log/nginx/localhost.access.log;
    	index index.php index.html index.htm;

    	error_page 500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
	
    	location /swi/ {
        	
        	if (-f $request_filename) {
            	expires max;
            	break;
        	}
    	
        	if (!-e $request_filename) {
            	rewrite ^/swi/(.*)$ /swi/index.php/$1 last;
        	}
    	}
    
    	location = /50x.html {
        	root /var/www/nginx-default;
    	}
	
    	location /swi/index.php {
        	fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        	fastcgi_index index.php;
        	fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/nginx-default/swi/index.php;
        	include fastcgi_params;
    	}
	}
